The forehand is one of the most important shots in tennis. Today we'll share 5 advanced tips that can take your forehand to the next level.

## 1. Early Shoulder Turn

Many recreational players prepare too late. You should start turning your shoulders as soon as you see the ball cross the net. Professional players complete most of their rotation before the ball even crosses the net.

**Practice tip:** Have a friend feed balls and focus on starting your shoulder turn the moment the ball crosses the net.

## 2. Use Your Legs

Forehand power doesn't come from your arm—it comes from the ground. By pushing off the ground, power transfers from your feet to your legs, hips, torso, and finally to your arm.

**Key points:**
- Keep knees bent before contact
- Push up from the ground during the shot
- Feel the power flowing from bottom to top

## 3. Relax Your Grip

Many players grip too tightly, which limits swing speed. Here's the correct approach:

- During preparation and backswing: relaxed grip (about 30% intensity)
- At contact: firm grip (about 80% intensity)
- During follow-through: relax again

## 4. Watch the Ball to Contact Point

This sounds simple, but many players don't do it. Train yourself to see the ball leave the racket face, rather than looking at your target too early.

## 5. Complete Follow-Through

Don't stop your motion after contact. Let the racket naturally wrap around your left shoulder (for right-handers), completing a full follow-through. This not only adds power but also protects your arm.

Remember, improving technique takes time and patience. Focus on one tip at a time during practice, gradually incorporating them into your forehand motion.

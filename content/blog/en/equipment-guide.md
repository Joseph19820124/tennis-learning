Choosing the right equipment is the first step to playing good tennis. This article will help you understand how to select equipment that suits you.

## Racket Selection

### Head Size

- **Large (100-110 sq in)**: Bigger sweet spot, more forgiving, ideal for beginners
- **Medium (95-100 sq in)**: Balance of control and power, good for intermediate players
- **Small (93-95 sq in)**: Precise control, suited for advanced players

### Racket Weight

- **Light (250-280g)**: Fast swing, suitable for beginners and women
- **Medium (280-310g)**: Well-balanced, suitable for most recreational players
- **Heavy (310g+)**: More stability, suited for power players

### Recommended Brands

Beginners should consider:
- Wilson Clash series
- Babolat Pure Drive Lite
- Head Speed series

## Tennis Shoes

Tennis shoes are the one piece of equipment you shouldn't skimp on! Good shoes protect your ankles and knees.

### What to Look For

1. **Lateral support** - Tennis involves lots of side-to-side movement; shoes must provide good lateral support
2. **Durable outsole** - Choose the sole type based on your usual court surface
3. **Comfort and breathability** - Should stay comfortable during long sessions
4. **Proper fit** - Consider going half a size up from your regular shoes

### Recommended Brands

- Asics Gel Resolution
- Nike Vapor Pro
- Adidas Barricade

## Tennis Strings

Don't forget that strings matter too!

- **Polyester**: Durable, good control, better for intermediate/advanced players
- **Nylon**: Soft, comfortable, good for beginners
- **Natural gut**: Best feel, but expensive

## Other Equipment

- **Tennis bag**: 3-6 racket capacity is plenty for recreational use
- **Wristbands/Headbands**: Absorb sweat, keep your grip dry
- **Vibration dampeners**: Reduce frame vibration, protect your wrist

## Summary

As a beginner, you don't need to buy the most expensive gear right away. Choose an appropriate entry-level racket, invest in good tennis shoes, and add other equipment gradually. As your skill level improves, you'll better understand what kind of equipment suits your game.
